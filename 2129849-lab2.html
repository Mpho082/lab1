            <p>
                Hello! My name is Mpho. I like to think of myself as somewhat of a sponge student, I absorb knowledge. 
                I am energetic and eager to learn. I think programming is like art, and \
                as a programmer you are an artist.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                One of my latest projects is a web-based task reminder app that sends you notifications reminding you to do your tasks like homework or work on your projrcts,
                and remind you of deadlines,
                 you can also set it to track your progress on your tasks. I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is by far my proudest creation.
